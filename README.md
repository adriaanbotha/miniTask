# Adore Beauty

### First to run
```npm install```

### Run development mode
```npm run dev```


### Run production mode
```npm run build```


### FYI - Built with Node version
v13.11.0

### Side Notes
1. Static or Dynamic - Is this simple case a case for NUXT or GatsbyJS, it is a good case for Nuxt, but I felt like demonstrating a bit more dynamica with using a non static site.
2. Is this a case for REST via GraphQL ? I need to follow instructions 
3. Testing - I have decided not to build in Jest testing for the front end, I feel this is a bit of an overkill for the types of function we have. If time permits I might do Snapshot testign on some views
4. There are some URL's hard coded and that might be better of inside a .dev environment
5. Responsiveness - Did not get to the Mobile view so it's mostly optimised for desktop view only
6. Accessibility - I have not optimised this for screen readers
7. Color test in Lighthouse - I have not optimised this for color testing
